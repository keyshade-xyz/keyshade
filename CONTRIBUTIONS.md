## Reporting Bugs/Issues

Before reporting a bug, please check our list of [open issues](https://github.com/keyshade-xyz/keyshade/issues) to see if someone has already reported the bug.

Information like a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce the issue, and any error messages are incredibly helpful.
