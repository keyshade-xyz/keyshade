              <p className="text-white/60">
                We believe Configuration Mangement is an easily overlooked part
                of software developement, all teams need it and all teams do it,
                but not in a proper systematic way, sometimes secrets are shared
                over slack ,sometimes over direct messages and often over email.
                This may be an easier solution in the beginning but as the size
                of your app grows , so does the amount of secrets you have to
                hide. That is when you start facing problems.

                How about a tool that can help you manage all your
                configurations with best in class security, and also streamline
                changes made to them to propagate to all applications that use
                them? How about a tool that helps you collaborate on
                configuration management like never before? This is where
                keyshade comes in
                <br />
                <br />
                keyshade is an open source configuration management platform
                that allows you to manage your secrets and variables in most
                logical way possible. It is a tool made with developer&apos;s
                ease at the top of mind, so, expect to never get blocked out by
                overwhelming complexity or steep learning curve.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our ecosystem of plugins allow you to integrate keyshade with
                any cloud provider on the planet! Are you consuming an API key
                in your GitHub Action workflow? No need to manage the `secrets`
                section. Rather let keyshade do the integration for you! Any
                time that you change a config in your dashboard, any and every
                application that uses that will also get updated accordingly -
                enabling you to not worry about restarting your application.
