   - Integrates with existing settings layout

## Files Modified

### Authentication Integration
1. **`apps/platform/src/components/auth/otp/otp-input-form.tsx`**
   - Added account manager integration on OTP verification
   - Stores authenticated user as a profile

2. **`apps/platform/src/app/auth/page.tsx`**
   - Added account manager integration for OAuth login
   - Stores OAuth-authenticated users as profiles

### UI Integration
3. **`apps/platform/src/components/shared/navbar/profile-menu.tsx`**
   - Added "Manage Accounts" menu item
   - Updated logout to clear all accounts

4. **`apps/platform/src/app/(main)/(settings)/settings/layout.tsx`**
   - Added accounts tab to settings layout
   - Routed accounts tab to account management page

## How It Works

### Storage Architecture
```
localStorage['keyshade_accounts'] = {
  version: "1.0.0",
  activeProfileId: "user-id-1",
  profiles: {
    "user-id-1": {
      id: "user-id-1",
      email: "user1@example.com",
      name: "User One",
      profilePictureUrl: "...",
      token: "jwt-token-1",
      isActive: true,
      lastUsed: "2025-10-03T...",
      workspaceId: "workspace-id-1"
    },
    "user-id-2": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Authentication Flow
```
User logs in
    ‚Üì
OTP/OAuth verification
    ‚Üì
accountManager.addProfile(user, token)
    ‚Üì
Profile stored in localStorage
    ‚Üì
Token set in cookies
    ‚Üì
User redirected to dashboard
```

### Switching Flow
```
User selects different account
    ‚Üì
accountManager.switchProfile(profileId)
    ‚Üì
Active profile updated
    ‚Üì
New token set in cookies
    ‚Üì
User atom updated
    ‚Üì
Page reloads with new context
```

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] Account storage in localStorage
- [x] Add multiple accounts via authentication

- [ ] Biometric authentication for switching
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for account switching
- [ ] Profile import/export
- [ ] Account nicknames/labels
- [ ] Token auto-refresh
- [ ] Multi-account notifications
- [ ] Profile-specific settings

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Add Multiple Accounts
```
1. Navigate to /auth
2. Login with first account (Email/Google/GitHub)
3. Complete onboarding if needed
4. Go to Settings ‚Üí Accounts
5. Click "Add Another Account"
6. Login with second account
7. Verify both accounts appear in the list
```

### 2. Switch Accounts
```
1. Click account switcher in navbar
2. Select different account
3. Verify page reloads
4. Check that workspace/projects reflect new account
```

### 3. Remove Account
```
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Accounts
2. Click trash icon on non-active account
3. Confirm removal
4. Verify account is removed from list
```

### 4. Logout All
```
1. Click profile menu
2. Select "Log out"
3. Verify redirected to login
4. Verify all accounts cleared (no profiles in switcher)
```

## CLI Comparison

The CLI already has robust profile management:
```bash
keyshade profile create    # Add new profile
keyshade profile list      # List profiles
keyshade profile use       # Switch active profile
keyshade profile update    # Update profile
keyshade profile delete    # Remove profile
```

This web implementation provides similar functionality with a graphical interface.

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Storage**: Tokens stored in localStorage (consider IndexedDB for better security)
2. **XSS Protection**: Use Content Security Policy headers
3. **Token Expiry**: Implement token refresh mechanism
4. **HTTPS Only**: Enforce HTTPS in production
5. **CSRF Protection**: Maintain CSRF token validation

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ‚úÖ Firefox (latest)
- ‚úÖ Safari (latest)
- ‚úÖ Opera (latest)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  IE11 (not supported - uses localStorage)

## Performance Considerations

- Profiles stored in localStorage (5-10MB limit)
- Lazy loading of profile data
- Efficient re-renders with React memoization
- No impact on initial page load

## Troubleshooting

### Profiles not persisting
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Verify no browser extensions blocking storage

### Cannot switch accounts
- Check console for errors
- Verify token is valid
- Try logging out and back in

### Account switcher not visible
- Ensure at least one account is logged in
- Check that profile data exists in localStorage

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with multiple accounts
2. **Gather user feedback** on UX
3. **Monitor performance** with many profiles
4. **Consider backend sync** for enterprise users
5. **Add analytics** to track usage patterns
