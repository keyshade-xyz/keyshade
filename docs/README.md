# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to keyshade

## What is Keyshade ?
Keyshade is a secret and environment variable manager designed for developers and teams. It helps you avoid hardcoded secrets, eliminate manual `.env` sharing, and keep environment configs in syncâ€”across local setups, CI/CD pipelines, and production. Whether you're solo or working with a team, Keyshade fits into your workflow with minimal setup and maximum security.

# What Can Keyshade Help With ?

Managing secrets sounds simpleâ€”until you're juggling .env files, onboarding teammates, and patching leaked tokens. Keyshade helps you solve these problems with a developer-first workflow thatâ€™s secure by design.
### Keeping teams and environments in sync
- Environment variables are often scattered across machines, CI pipelines, cloud dashboards, and shared files. Itâ€™s hard to know who has the latest version or whether your staging and production configs match.

- **Keyshade keeps everything in one place and lets you sync secrets across environments with a single command.**

### Preventing accidental leaks
- Itâ€™s surprisingly easy to commit a secret by mistake. A single hardcoded token can lead to a production incidentâ€”or worse.
- **Keyshade scans your codebase for exposed credentials and helps you clean them up before they become a problem.**

### Making secret changes safe and trackable
- Changing secrets manually means if something breaks after a change, itâ€™s hard to trace what happenedâ€”or roll back.
- **Keyshade keeps a history of every change, so you can track updates, audit changes, or revert configs when needed.**

### Managing who gets access to what
- Not every team member needs access to every environment or secret. But setting up fine-grained access is usually clunky or not supported at all.
- **Keyshade lets you control access per project, per environmentâ€”so devs get what they need, and nothing more.**

### Reducing manual effort
- Changing something as simple as a client ID often means logging into cloud dashboards, restarting servers, or editing configs in multiple places.
- **Keyshade lets you update secrets without restarting your app and automatically pulls fresh values at runtime.**

## Who is Keyshade for ?
Whether you're building solo or deploying with a team, Keyshade takes the pain out of managing secrets.
- **Solo Developers** â€“ Stop copying .env files between machines. Keep everything in sync, securely.
- **Teams** â€“ Share secrets without leaking them. Everyone gets access to what they needâ€”and nothing more.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** â€“ Inject secrets at runtime without storing them in plaintext or restarting your app.
- **Security-Minded Projects** â€“ Secrets are encrypted end-to-end and only decrypted on your machine. Even we can't see them.
