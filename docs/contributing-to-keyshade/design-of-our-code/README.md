# Design of our code

## Brief

When it comes to developing for us, we follow very strict norms! From proper indentation to using design patterns, we do an extensive coverage. But this is really difficult for anyone to grab randomly. So we decided to compile how each of our modules undergo development and the structure they follow.

## Compilation of designs

- [Organization Of Code](organization-of-code.md)

* [API](api.md)
* [Web](web.md)
* [CLI](cli.md)
* [Integrations](integrations.md)
