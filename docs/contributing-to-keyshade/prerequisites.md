# Prerequisites

Of course, to get started, you will need to have the required components in place. Gladly, there isn't much that needs to be done:

* Make sure you have Git installed and have an account in GitHub
* Have an account in Supabase along with a project
* Have your SMTP credentials ready (only for backend development)
