# API Testing

We use Postman to test our APIs. All of our endpoints are tested using Postman and we maintain a detailed documentation of every endpoint in our Postman collection. You can find the workspace in [here](https://www.postman.com/blue-crescent-581920/workspace/keyshade)

We maintain an API named [`keyshade API`](https://www.postman.com/keyshade/workspace/keyshade) in our Postman workspace. This API contains all the endpoints that we have in our application. This is where you can find all the collections which you can use to develop/test our APIs

## Getting started

- For starters, make sure you have Postman installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- Once you have Postman installed, you can go to the API link mentioned above.
- For every collection in the API, the requests hold one or more examples that you can use to test the API. You can also find the schema of the request itself.
