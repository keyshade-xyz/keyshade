# Set up Keyshade with Node.js

**Keyshade** securely manages your environment variables and secrets â€” no more `.env` files, and nothing sensitive committed to your repo.

This guide will walk you through setting up Keyshade in a Node.js app, step by step.

## Create a Node.js Project

If you don't already have a Node.js app, create one:

```bash
mkdir <your-app-name>
cd <your-app-name>
npm init -y
```

For TypeScript projects, add the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node
npx tsc --init
```

## Install the Keyshade CLI

The Keyshade CLI lets you fetch secrets, inject env variables, and manage profiles all from your terminal.

Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g @keyshade/cli
```

**Note:** Node.js v24 may cause issues with the Keyshade CLI, so use v20 (LTS) for best compatibility.

> See [Installing the CLI](/docs/getting-started/installing-the-cli.md) for more info.

## Set Up Your Profile

To connect your local environment with Keyshade, create or use a profile.

If this is your **first time using Keyshade**, follow [this guide to set up your profile](/docs/getting-started/setting-up-your-profile.md).

If you've already used Keyshade before:

```bash
keyshade profile use <your-profile-name>
```

You can verify which profile is active with:

```bash
keyshade workspace list
```

## Create a Project and Add Secrets

To get started:

1.  Go to the [Keyshade Dashboard](https://app.keyshade.xyz/)
2.  Click **"Create Project"**
3.  Name your project (e.g. `nodejs-app`)
4.  Inside the project, click the **"Secrets"** tab
5.  Add your **secrets** (e.g. `API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`)
6.  Add your **variables** (e.g. `PORT`)

> ðŸ’¡ **Secrets vs Variables:**
>
> -   **Secrets** are sensitive values â€” like API keys or access tokens â€” and are encrypted for security.
>     
> -   **Variables** are non-sensitive settings â€” like ports, feature flags, or toggles â€” and are stored as plain values, not encrypted.
 
> Need help with projects and secrets? See [Managing Secrets & Variables](/docs/getting-started/adding-your-first-secret-and-variable.md)

## Initialize Keyshade in Your Project

In order to use the configurations you just created on the dashboard, you would need to initialize keyshade in your project. This generates the necessary configurations for the CLI to tap into your keyshade project.

From your project root:

```bash
cd <your-app-name>
```

Run the init command to link your local project with the Keyshade dashboard:

```bash
keyshade init
```

You'll be guided through selecting your workspace, project, and environment.

Want to skip the prompts?

```bash
keyshade init --workspace-slug <my-workspace> --project-slug <my-project> --environment-slug <my-environment> --private-key <my-private-key>
```

This will generate a `keyshade.json` file in your project root.

> More on this in the [CLI Reference](/docs/getting-started/installing-the-cli.md)

## Run Your App with Secure Env Injection

Start your Node.js app with Keyshade:

For JavaScript:

```bash
keyshade run -- node index.js
```

For TypeScript:

```bash
keyshade run -- ts-node index.ts
```

Or if you have npm scripts defined in `package.json`:

```bash
keyshade run -- npm start
```

Example output:

![Node.js Run](../../../blob/keyshade-nodejs-run.png)

Keyshade will inject your secrets and variables securely at runtime.

## Access Secrets and Variables in Your Code

Once your app is running with `keyshade run`, use `process.env` to access any injected values â€” no extra setup needed.

For example, if you added a secret named `DATABASE_URL` and a variable named `PORT` in the Keyshade dashboard:

In JavaScript:

```javascript
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

In TypeScript:

```typescript 
const dbUrl: string | undefined = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const port: number = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000');
```

### Example Node.js Server

Create a simple Express server in `index.js`:

![Express server in JS](../../../blob/nodejs-guide-js-code.png)

Now run it with `keyshade run -- node index.js` and you'll see your server start with all secrets securely injected.

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to confirm your secrets are being injected properly. See below for reference:

**You're All Set ðŸš€**

_Your Node.js app is now securely powered by Keyshade â€” no `.env` files, no leaking secrets, and no environment mismatches._
