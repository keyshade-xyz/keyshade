This guide walks you through how to configure Slack bot credentials and set up Keyshade to send events to your Slack workspace.

## Create a Slack App and Get Bot Credentials

Keyshade sends notifications to Slack using a Slack App with bot permissions. Youâ€™ll need to create a Slack app, assign it proper permissions, and get the bot token, signing secret, and channel ID.

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

- Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
- Click **Create New App** > Choose **From scratch**

- Enter an **App Name** like `Keyshade Notifier`
- Select your **Workspace**
- Click **Create App**

---

### Step 2: Assign Bot Permissions

- Once you created the app, you are directed to the app dashboard
- In the app dashboard, go to **OAuth & Permissions**
- Under **Bot Token Scopes**, add these scopes (adjust based on Keyshade docs):
  - `chat:write` (to send messages)
  - `channels:read` (to list channels)
  - `groups:read`
  - `im:read`
  - `mpim:read`

- Authorize the app
- After installation, copy the **Bot User OAuth Access Token** (starts with `xoxb-...`)

- Copy the **Signing Secret** (used for request verification)

---

### Step 5: Find the Channel ID

### Step 1: Access Integration Settings

- Go to the [Keyshade Dashboard](https://app.keyshade.xyz/)
- Select your project
- In the sidebar, click **Integrations**
- Click **Add Integration**
- Select **Slack** from the options

---

### Step 2: Configure Slack Integration in Keyshade

- **Integration Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `Keyshade Slack Alerts`)
- **Bot Token**: Paste the Slack bot token (`xoxb-...`) from your Slack app
- **Signing Secret**: Paste the Slack signing secret
- **Channel ID**: Paste the Slack channel ID where messages should be posted
- **Event Triggers**:
  - Secret Events (added, updated, deleted)
  - Variable Events
  - Integration Errors
  - Manual Syncs

> Enable all event triggers for full visibility or select only what you need.

- Click **Save Integration**

---

## Test the Integration

### Step 1: Send a Test Message

- After saving, click **Test Integration**
- A test notification will be sent to your Slack channel

### Step 2: Verify in Slack

- Open your Slack channel
- You should see a message like:

  > **Keyshade Integration Test**  
  > This is a test message from your Keyshade Slack integration. Everything is working smoothly!

- Try adding test variables and secrets, you should see an update in the designated channel

---

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No messages in Slack?**
  - Double-check the bot token, signing secret, and channel ID
  - Confirm your Slack app has the required permissions and is installed properly
  - Make sure the bot is invited to the target channel (or the channel is public)
  - Try reinstalling the Slack app to the workspace

- **Too many messages?**
  - Fine-tune event triggers in Keyshade integration settings
  - Create multiple integrations for separate environments or projects

### Best Practices

1. Use dedicated Slack channels like `#keyshade-alerts` to keep notifications organized
2. Enable alerts for critical events such as failed syncs or secret updates
3. Use emojis or tags in messages for better visibility and urgency
4. Combine with other integrations (e.g., AWS Lambda, GitHub) for full observability
5. Rotate your bot tokens and signing secrets periodically for security
