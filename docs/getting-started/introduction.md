# Introduction

This walkthrough is a mini-blog about how to get started with Keyshade. We would take you through the steps required to install the CLI, add secrets and variables to your project, and finally to use them in your app. We would be using a Next.js project to demonstrate the process.

Here's the list of contents, feel free to skip to any section you like.
