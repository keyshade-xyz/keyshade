# Creating a project

You would need to create a project to start importing your environment variables to keyshade. 

## Creating a new project

Head over to [https://app.keyshade.io](https://app.keyshade.io). This is where you get to access our platform. Log in with your email, or your favourite OAuth provider. Once inside, you should be greeted with a similar page like this:

Now, we can start creating our project.

- Click on **Create Project**
- Enter your project name
- Optionally, you can store the private key in the project **(not recommended in production projects)**
- Edit or add environments if you want to
- Finally, click on **Create Project**
- Download the private and public key then hit on **Close**.
